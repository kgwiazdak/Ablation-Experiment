# Ablation-Experiment
This experiment was performed for Ai Safety Fundamentals course. 

Experiment presents differences between ablations and shows when specified ablation type can break. I considered several heads types and 3 ablation types: zero, mean and resample. Recently optimal ablation came over, "Optimal ablation for interpretability", arXiv:2409.09951. It hasn't been considered within this collab as I met some obstackles with running their code but their work brings bright update to an ablation field.
